# generate a list $lst, containing 20 members, each member a random INT, from 0 to 15; print it
# remove all duplicates from this list
# remove all list members bigger than 11
# create a list $months of month names, by using "calendar" library, here is how:
'''
from calendar import month_name
months = month_name[1:]
'''
# note that this is a different format of using import; previously we were using import function this way:
'''
import calendar
months = calendar.month_name[1:]
'''
# print $months list; try both ways of using import functionality
# print $months list; try both ways of using import functionality
# try to use calendar.month_name[0:] instead of calendar.month_name[1:], see the difference

# create a dictionary $dict, where indexes are numbers from $lst
# and dictionary members are corresponding month names from $months list; print it

# create list of weekdays, as 
'''
days = calendar.day_name[0:]
'''
# create a dictionary $dict1, where indexes are numbers from $lst and 
# dictionary members are respective weekday names from $days list - if they exist;
# if index is too big, dictionary member should be "-"
# print $dict1
